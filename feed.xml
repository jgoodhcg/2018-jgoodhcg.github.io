When it was removed, for whatever reason, it kind of ruined my note process. I like to take quick notes with the position so I can revise by listening back whenever I get around to it. Now I have to include the position manually when I export to Roam's quick capture screen. It's an annoying context switch.This problem got me thinking about taking notes on audio in general . There isn't a good solution for the niche of second brain users. I want Roam and Notion integrated directly in the player for seamless note taking without context switching. I actually have the skills needed to build this, so I made a Proof of Concept over a weekend.</description><pubDate>Sat, 20 Feb 2021 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate></item><item><guid>https://jgood.io/2020-12-20-failed-gesture-experiment</guid><link>https://jgood.io/2020-12-20-failed-gesture-experiment</link><title>‚ùå Failed Gesture Experiment</title><description>GistI had an idea for a complicated set of gestures for an app I'm working on. Not being sure how it would work I made an experiment app to test it out. Ran into two problems so I'm tossing the whole idea.</description><pubDate>Sun, 20 Dec 2020 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate></item><item><guid>https://jgood.io/2020-12-20-video-production-notes</guid><link>https://jgood.io/2020-12-20-video-production-notes</link><title>üìΩÔ∏è Video Production Notes</title><description>WhyI made a goal to write 3 blog posts before 2020-12-21 and this is the third. It's a note compilation from watching videos on youtube about video production. Everybody is starting a youtube channel so I've shared this multiple times. I figured it would make a nice post.</description><pubDate>Sun, 20 Dec 2020 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate></item><item><guid>https://jgood.io/2020-10-25-memento-mori</guid><link>https://jgood.io/2020-10-25-memento-mori</link><title>üíÄ Memento Mori Life Chart Experiment</title><description>InspirationI came across two websites with a visualization of a 90 year old life measured in weeks.</description><pubDate>Sun, 25 Oct 2020 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate></item><item><guid>https://jgood.io/2020-09-03-playing-with-vega-lite-pt-1</guid><link>https://jgood.io/2020-09-03-playing-with-vega-lite-pt-1</link><title>üìà Vega-Lite Fun Pt-1</title><description>I'm obsessive about tracking personal metrics, and I want to make data visualizations.

The goal was to make it easier for me and others to start a project on this stack. The ideal state wasn't a repo that needs manual setup. The ideal state is one command that generates a ready to run project. This post will describe how I made an npm module called create-expo-cljs-app.The Target</description><pubDate>Sun, 05 Apr 2020 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate></item><item><guid>https://jgood.io/2020-01-26-expo-shadow-cljs-starter</guid><link>https://jgood.io/2020-01-26-expo-shadow-cljs-starter</link><title>A template for Expo apps with Shadow CLJS</title><description>Do you want to make a native app? Are you familiar with a React stack? Do you also want to write in Clojure? Then the solution is -- Expo with Shadow CLJS. It's an easy technology transition and a well maintained platform to build on. I've used Expo with plain Javascript at my day job for a couple of years.
